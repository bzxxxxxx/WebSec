# DOM Clobbering 

Dom clobbering is a technique in which you inject HTML into a page to manipulate the DOM and ultimately change the behaviour of javascript on the page.

# Basics

id attribute => The id attribute specifies the elements unique identifier.

```html
document.getElementById('hello')

is same as 

window.hello
```

name attribute => The name attribute specifies a name for an html element

The window object 
```
The window object is supported by all browsers. It represents the browser's window. All global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object. Global variables are properties of the window object. Global functions are methods of the window object.

Basically we can Declare Variables in javascript in 3 methods. var, let, const. Variables Declared with var are stored under window object with key as variable name and value as declared variable's value
```

The document object
```
The document object represents your web page. If you want to access any element in an HTML page, you always start with accessing the document object.
```
