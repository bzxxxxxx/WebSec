# DOM Clobbering 

Dom clobbering is a technique in which you inject HTML into a page to manipulate the DOM and ultimately change the behaviour of javascript on the page.

# Basics

id attribute => The id attribute specifies the elements unique identifier.

```html
document.getElementById('hello')

is same as 

window.hello
```

name attribute => The name attribute specifies a name for an html element
