# Google XSS Game

Beginner level XSS challenge from google

# level 1

Just basic <script>alert("Ok")</script> injection into the input field, The user input is send to the server from where it gets echoed(Just like in PHP) hence the script tag is executed.

# level 2

Still whatever we give as an input is embedded on to the website, but unlike last level this method prevents <script> tag execution so we had find another way to get execute here we  can give an input like this <img src="x" onerror='alert("OMG")'> , Here the img tag will try to load the image content from the source x which will result in an error, so the onerror event will be called which will inturn call the alert function.

# level 3

An interesting level indeed so inspecting the source code we could see that the tab number gets embedded in the img tag , so we could pass something like 'onerror="alert('OMG')",
So here we're closing the source tag and there would be an error loading the image and then same thing as level 2.

# level 4

Here the user input is send as a get request to the server which has some python backend to it, the backend returns a template which has the value of timer as set by the user, and we're passing this value to startimer function when onload event happens, onload="startTimer('{{ timer }}');" if the timer value is 3');alert("omg" the code becomes
onload="startTimer('3');alert("omg");" hence alert will get executed.

# level 5

In input field where we have to input out email actually in the backend the server gets the name of the parameter from the url and sets it as the value for next variable which is used as the hyperlink for the a tag hence if we pass href=```javascript:alert("omg")``` as  a parameter then then it will get set the href for the a attribute so when the user clicks on the a tag the javascript code gets executed.

# level 6
