# Google XSS Game

Beginner level XSS challenge from google

# level 1

Just basic <script>alert("Ok")</script> injection into the input field, The user input is send to the server from where it gets echoed(Just like in PHP) hence the script tag is executed.

# level 2

Still whatever we give as an input is embedded on to the website, but unlike last level this method prevents <script> tag execution so we had find another way to get execute here we  can give an input like this <img src="x" onerror='alert("OMG")'> , Here the img tag will try to load the image content from the source x which will result in an error, so the onerror event will be called which will inturn call the alert function.

# level 3

An interesting level indeed so inspecting the source code we could see that the tab number gets embedded in the img tag , so we could pass something like 'onerror="alert('OMG')",
So here we're closing the source tag and there would be an error loading the image and then same thing as level 2.

# level 4
