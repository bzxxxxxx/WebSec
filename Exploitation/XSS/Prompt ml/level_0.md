# level 0

```js
function escape(input) {
    // warm up
    // script should be executed without user interaction
    return '<input type="text" value="' + input + '">';
}        
```


In this level we had user input control over the DOM so we had to just use sqli logic to bypass the payload was ```"><script>prompt(1)</script>```
