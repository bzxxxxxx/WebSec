```js
function escape(input) {
    // filter potential comment end delimiters
    input = input.replace(/->/g, '_');

    // comment the input to avoid script execution
    return '<!-- ' + input + ' -->';
}        
```

Here everything we input is getting commented so we need to close the comment first for that we can use ```--!>``` as the version of closing the html comment is filetered this is also a valid way to close html comments. Hence we could get script execution.
