# Cache poisoning

## keyed, unkeyed values, Cache buster queries, Cache headers

When we send a request the response from the client is often cached in the frontend servers this reduces the load on the backend server.

The cache server identifies whether it should cache a response or not based on cache keys these are usually headers, ie if the cache key changes then the cache server would cache the reponse if the cache key remains the same the cache server wont forward the request to the backend.

Unkeyed values are those values that the cache server don't care about ie they could change independently without affecting the caching mechanism.

If an application is using some part of our user input we can potentially cache a malicious payload and this would served to the users who are having the same cache key.

This is basically what is called cache poisoning.
