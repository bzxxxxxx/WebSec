# Level 10

```php
<?php include "flag.php"; ?>
<?php
        if (isset ($_REQUEST['f']) && isset ($_REQUEST['hash'])) {
            $file = $_REQUEST['f'];
            $request = $_REQUEST['hash'];

            $hash = substr (md5 ($flag . $file . $flag), 0, 8);

            echo '<div class="row"><br><pre>';
            if ($request == $hash) {
            show_source ($file);
            } else {
            echo 'Permission denied!';
            }
            echo '</pre></div>';
        }
        ?>
```

$_REQUEST contains all of $_GET,$_POST and stuff

okay i looked at the writeups for this one, after trying for over 1 week, so it was just exploiting the loose comparison

here is the exploit code, as .///// would still execute the same file
