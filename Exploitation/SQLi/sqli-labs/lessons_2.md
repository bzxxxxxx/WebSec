# WIP LESSON 5 to

This time we're not allowed to use comments,consider there is a system which filters out the comments.

Consider our query looks like this

select id,username,password from table where id='1'.

So consider our input as 1' or '1

so it'll be,
select id,username,password from table where id='1' or '1'

So here '1' or '1' will be evaluated and 1 will be returned which will fetch all the username and password from the database but the website will only display the first row

When we give input as 1' and '1 the first page gets shown and when we give input as 2'  and '3 the second page gets shown.. why??
