# WIP LESSON 5 to

This time we're not allowed to use comments,consider there is a system which filters out the comments.

Consider our query looks like this

select id,username,password from table where id='1'.

So consider our input as 1' or '1

so it'll be,
select id,username,password from table where id='1' or '1'

doubt -> why does it always show the page 1 no matter what we give the input as.

When we give input as 1' and '1 the first page gets shown and when we give input as 2'  and '3 the second page gets shown.. why??
