# Subdomain takeover

Subdomain takeover is a type of vulnerability that occurs when a subdomain of a website is pointing to a service that is no longer in use or has been abandoned by the owner.
This can happen when a third-party service that was previously used by the website is no longer available, but the DNS record for the subdomain still points to it.
An attacker can take advantage of this by registering the service and taking control of the subdomain, which can lead to various attacks such as phishing, malware distribution, and stealing sensitive information. It is important for website owners to regularly monitor their subdomains and remove any that are no longer in use to prevent subdomain takeover attacks.
