The protocol specifies how information from the link is transferred. Examples of protocols include HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, telnet etc.

Domain name specifies the organization or entity that the URL belongs to.

A port number specifies the type of service that is requested by the client since servers often deliver multiple services

Path specifies the exact location of the web page, file, or any resource that the user wants access to.

The parameters are used by the webserver to do any additional tasks before displaying a website or returning a resource.

The anchor is a way to locate a specific location within a resource.
