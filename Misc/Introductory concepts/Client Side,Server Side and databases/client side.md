# Client side

In web development, the 'client side' refers to everything in a web application that is displayed or takes place on the client (the browser or end-user device).

This includes what the user sees, such as text, images, and the rest of the UI, along with any actions that an application performs within the user's browser.

The Client-Side Language is a set of languages that actually runs on the client(runs in a browser).

Users can easily view and debug such programs.

Example: HTML,CSS,Javascript,jQuery
