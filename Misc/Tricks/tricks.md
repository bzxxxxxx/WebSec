# Tricks

-> usually length checks can be bypassed if we give our input as an array in a request, so what might seem impossible might actually not be impossible.
-> Some shortcuts, ctrl + shift + i, chrome devtools
-> SetInterval internally calls eval and toString by default so DOM clobbering could work here.
