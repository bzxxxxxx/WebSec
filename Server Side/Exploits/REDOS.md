# Regular Expressions Denial Of Service

Most the regex engines today are not that efficient, so certain regex patterns can get stuck on user input, as the engine is computing all the possible matches which could take exponential time. Such regex implementations are called evil regexes.

## Regex 

``[]`` defines a character class.

``[]`` matches gray,grey. We can also specify a range here ``[0-9a-fA-F]`` matches hex a single hex char

``q[^x]`` negation statement, that means that ``q[^x]`` matches the word question but doesn't match the word qxert.

``\d`` matches a digit.

``\w`` matches a word.

``gr.y`` matches any char, like grey,gray etc

``^b`` matches the first word that means it matches the first word bob.

``cat | dog`` matches either cat or dog.

``colou?r`` optional character, matches both color and colour.

`` <[A-Za-z0-9]+>`` the ``+`` matches the previous one or more times.

 ``<[A-Za-z0-9]*>`` the ``*`` matches the previous zero or more times.

 ``[1-9][0-9]{2,3}`` matches digits between 100 and 1000,``{}`` defines the amount of repetition.


 Thats the basics.
