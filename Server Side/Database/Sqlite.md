# sqlite

So sqlite is a database engine written in C its pretty much like sql in terms of syntax only difference lies between the names of tables and columns between these two database engines, as information_schema in mysql is the sqlite_master in sqlite3.

It does provide a CLI, invoked by sqlite3 command in arch linux.
