  $query = "select id from prob_zombie_assassin where id='{$_GET[id]}' and pw='{$_GET[pw]}'"; 
  echo "<hr>query : <strong>{$query}</strong><hr><br>"; 
  $result = @mysqli_fetch_array(mysqli_query($db,$query));

```

Similar to the previous challenge, but here we had to give the input as reverse and then like the previous challenge we have to id as \ but here its blocked so we had to give the url encoded format that is "%00"

So the payload was ?id=%00&pw=%231=1%20ro
