# Request methods

Request methods are just the format of the HTTP request that we are sending. There are a lot of Requests methods used on the web but the two most commonly used are GET and POST.

Given below are a few request methods along with short descriptions of what they are used for:

GET  - Request to get information  from a source.
POST - Append information to a source.
HEAD - Get the header of a response initiated through a request.
PUT  - Append information to a source if the  information doesn't already exists it creates one or replaces the existing one,It sends the entire file as opposed to sending a specific data which is done by a post request.
DELETE - Delete an existing resource from a source.
TRACE - The web server will respond to requests that use the TRACE method by echoing in its response the exact request that was received.
CONNECT - It is used to establish a  TCP/IP tunnel connection.
