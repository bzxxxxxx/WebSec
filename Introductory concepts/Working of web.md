## Working of the web

WWW(World Wide Web) is a collection of webpages that are stored on the internet.

Clients and Servers are those devices which are connected to the internet.
Client side programming deals with the stuff that happens on the client side.
Server side programming deals with the stuff that happens on the server side.

When a client types in the url to a web browser first the DNS provides the ip address of the website and then the request is made to that ip address after that the
Web server returns the requested content back to the client machine(http response).
