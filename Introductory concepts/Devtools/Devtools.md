DevTools
Modern web browsers have a feature known as developer tools which enable the end-user or a developer to interact with DOM(Document Object Model) elements, CSS, and also execute JavaScript on their browser. They can be used for testing and development purposes.

The development tools provide some fundamental features such as:

JavaScript debugging
Web page assets, resources, and network information
Manipulating DOM elements
Profiling and auditing
Editing and accessing HTTP cookies
