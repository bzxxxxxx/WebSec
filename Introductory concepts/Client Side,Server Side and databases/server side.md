# Server side

Much like with the client-side, 'server side' means everything that happens on the server, instead of on the client.

In the past, nearly all business logic ran on the server-side, and this included rendering dynamic webpages, interacting with databases, identity authentication, and push notifications.

The server-side code cannot be seen on the browser, unlike the client-side HTML and CSS.

Interconnection between server-side and client-side:

Although the server-side and the client-side module are variated and different from each other but essentially both the modules are interlinked to each other for establishing the engagement between the two servers(server-side and client-side). Let's understand the relation between the client-side and server-side with the help of an example:

Consider a user who is using this very platform to retrieve some information or data from the server.

The first step will be the user requesting the data or the information to the server via a web service such as the internet.

The server reads the request from the user in order to find the information or data from the database.

Once the data is recouped by the server from the database, it is then sent as a response to the user via the web service.

But this data can't be directly sent or received by the client or the user, there are a certain set of rules or protocols that are to be followed before being able to either transmit or retrieve the data this protocol is called HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or the HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) where these protocols are used for secure communication over a computer network.
