# PHP 

Hypertext preprocessor, Is server side language aimed at developing web apps, PHP code is usually interpreted on the server side by some php interpreter which runs as a daemon.The language was created in 1993 by Rasmus Lerdorf.

Now why are we interested in this language?

According to wikipedia  "PHP is used by 77.8% of all the websites whose server-side programming language we know."[18] It also reports that only 8% of PHP users use the currently supported 8.x versions. Most use unsupported PHP 7, more specifically 7.4, and even PHP 5 has 23% of the use, also not supported with security updates, known to have serious security vulnerabilities.

So learning this language becomes a core corcern for those looking to understand websecurity better.
