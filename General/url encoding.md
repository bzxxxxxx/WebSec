# Why do we need to encode urls?

We encode URLs to ensure that they can be transmitted and interpreted correctly by computers and web browsers. Encoding replaces certain characters in a URL with a percent sign followed by two hexadecimal digits, which represent the character's ASCII code. This avoids confusion between special characters that have a specific meaning in a URL syntax, such as slashes and question marks, and those that are meant to be interpreted as part of the URL's content. Additionally, encoding allows non-ASCII characters to be represented in a URL, ensuring that URLs are universally accessible and can be used to link to resources regardless of the language or character set used.
