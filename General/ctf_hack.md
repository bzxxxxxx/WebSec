# CTF Hack 

How to approach different Web based ctf challenges

## Challenges with Large codebases

-> First of all build the app locally and inspect every other feature that this app has.
-> After that identify where is the flag residing in the service, and think of possible ways to get the flag.
-> Just don't blindly read the code base identify some unwanted features/code in the app that won't be there in a real world applications, usually this will lead to the a successful exploit.
-> Visualize the idea,exploit, learn what you have to learn, read the docs and the  craft the exploit.
-> There will be always unintended ways to solve a challenge.
-> Run the exploit and pray.
