# XS Leaks

# XS leaks using iframe Oracle

Consider a scenario in which you have a website you send that website's link to another user, now what your website does is it opens some new windows using something like 
```js
let ctx = window.open("https://bank.com");
```
So that we have a control of the opened window, Now consider that the victim is logged into the bank's website so that means the user will be viewing his logged in screen other than his login screen that means a lot of new iframes will get opened on the users end, now since we have a handle to the users open window we can know the number of iframes that there is, thereby we can calculate if the user is logged in or not by knowing the number if iframes that are getting logged, if there are more iframes then we can say that the user is logged in otherwiser the user is not logged in. This will lead critical vulnerability disclosure
