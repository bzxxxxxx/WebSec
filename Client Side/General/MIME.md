# MIME types

A media type (also known as a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions or MIME type) indicates the nature and format of a document, file, or assortment of bytes.

MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) types are used to specify the format of a file that is being transmitted over the internet or sent as an email attachment. They are important because they help browsers, email clients, and servers determine how to handle the data being transmitted and how to display it to the user.

For example, when you send a file as an email attachment, the recipient's email client uses the MIME type to determine how to display the file. If the MIME type indicates that the file is a JPEG image, the email client will display the image inline within the email message. If the MIME type indicates that the file is a PDF document, the email client will either display the document within the email or offer the option to download it.
