# Service Worker

Service workers essentially act as proxy servers that sit between web applications, the browser, and the network (when available). They are used to cache different responses and then redeliver it when there is no network connectivity. They are built to enhance the offline experience.

They also run on a seperate thread than the website JavaScript. So they have no access to the DOM.
